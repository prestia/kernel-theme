# kernel-theme

A theme for [Jekyll-Bootstrap](https://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap) loosely based on [Twitter Boostrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and the [Kernel Magazine](http://kernelmag.com) layout.

## Usage

Kernel-theme is actually a complete repo of my personal blog. It is a highly opinionated layout that may require a bit of tweaking to make perfect for your own uses. Please remove and original content from the layout (blog posts, about pages, etc.) before using it for your own website.

## Contributing

Although kernel-theme is highly opinionated and designed to suit my own purposes, I welcome refinements and improvements. Feel free to fork the repo and make suggestions.
