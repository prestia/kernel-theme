  <h1>Stupid iPhone Tricks</h1>

<div class="row">
  <div class="span10">
    <p>I picked up an iPhone just over a month ago and was surprised to see how many iOS features are completely unknown to even long-time users. I decided to publish a few of my favorites below. I tried to stick to lesser-known and/or undocumented features, but a few exceptions were made for features with great utility that could easily be overlooked. A number of additional tips are available on <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/tips/">Apple's website</a>. Feel free to <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01FAJRu4IEah-HzAYVZTRecg==&amp;c=fcbpT_qA3-yRrkBAuz9xC_Vh6XpgWTxxP6Wrpan1bzo=">submit</a> any tricks that I might have missed.
&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Keyboard Tricks</h2>

<h3>Quick Top-Level Domains</h3>

<p>Most people are comfortable using the ".com" button when entering a URL into Safari. However, few realize that if you briefly hold down the ".com" button an extended list of top-level domains appears. This makes accessing your favorite .net, .edu, .org, and .us domains a snap.</p>

<h3>Special Characters</h3>

<p>Have a friend with a pesky tilde in her name? Enjoy a good umlaut now and again? iOS has you covered!
Similar to the quick top-level domain trick, a handy menu pops up whenever you hold down a commonly "accessorized" character. Notably, this trick works for accented vowels as well as punctuation marks like the upsidedown questionmark and ellipsis. Play around and see what else you can find!</p>

<h3>Quick Periods</h3>

<p>When typing, it is not necessary to end each sentence with a period. When you reach the end of a sence, simply hit the spacebar twice and iOS will automatically end the prior sentence with a period followed by a space.</p>

<h3>Quick Punctuation &amp; Numerals</h3>

<p>When inserting punctuation and numerals into your writing, you needn't hit the ".?123" button, select your character of choice, and switch back to the qwerty keyboard with the "ABC" button. Instead, you can simply hold the ".?123" button until the punctuation and numeral keys appear, slide over to the character of choice, and then lift your finger from the screen. Sure, it's still a three-step process, but it's only one button press and lightning quick!
&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Multitasking Interface</h2>

<p>One thing that amazes me is the number iPhone veterans that still don't realize that multitasking was introduced in iOS 4. To access this feature, simply double tap the home button and a multitasking interface is displayed at the bottom of the screen. Swipe the interface to the left to dig deeper into your history of recently used applications. Tap any app's icon to pick up where you left off.</p>

<h3>Quick Music Access and Music Control</h3>

<p>From the first page of the multitasking interface (double tap the home button), swipe to the right instead of the left. Here you will find an icon to access whatever music app you last used (iPod, Pandora, Rdio, Spotify, etc.) as well as a few simple music controls.</p>

<h3>Lock the Screen Orientation</h3>

<p>From the first page of the multitasking interface (double tap the home button), swipe to the right. In addition to the music controls and iPod icon, there is a grey icon on the left with a curved arrow. Tapping this icon will lock the orientation of the screen. This is particularly helpful for those that love reading sideways or upsidedown.</p>

<h3>Forcing an Application to Restart</h3>

<p>Although iOS applications tend to be pretty stable, it's inevitable that a few bugs creep through the certification process and leave you with a non-responsive app. If this happens, simply exit the application by hitting the home button. Once out of the application, double click the home button to bring up the multitasking interface. Next, tap and hold any app icon in the multitasking interface until they all begin to wobble and display a red circle with a white - (minus) in the upper left corner. Unlike the traditional red circle with an x inside, tapping these symbols will not delete the app from your phone. Instead, these symbols simply force the application to stop running in the background. You can then reopen that application in the normal fashion and it should, hopefully, be working as normal. Notably, you can scroll through your extended history of applications to close apps that started malfunctioning long ago.
&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Other Tricks &amp; Hacks</h2>

<h3>Screenshots</h3>

<p>There are plenty of times when taking a picture of your iPhone's screen would come in handy. Fortunately, such a feature is integrated into iOS. Simply push the home button and power button simultaneously and the screen wil flash white signifying that a picture has been taken. You can later retrieve these photos from within the Photo app, just as you would a photo taken with the iPhone camera.</p>

<h3>Fast Scrolling</h3>

<p>In many apps that require a substantial amount of scrolling, a simple tap of the status bar (the bar up top that displays time and battery information) will instantly scroll you back to the top of the document. This is especially useful in Mail, Safari, and a number of Twitter apps.</p>

<h3>Advanced Music Control</h3>

<p>Many people don't realize that the default iPhone headset actually has a number of tricks tucked into the microphone. On any version of the iPhone headset (with or without volume controls), clicking the middle of the microphone yields the following results:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>One click:</strong> Pause or resume playing music or, if you have an incoming call, pause music and answer the call or hang up the call and resume music</li>
<li><strong>Two clicks:</strong> Skip to the next track</li>
<li><strong>Three clicks:</strong> Return to the previous track</li>
</ul>


<h3>Emoticons/Emoji</h3>

<p>As a warning, this is a bit more of a hack than a trick. Ever since the introduction of iOS 2.2, Apple has included a fairly large (and often strange) library of emoticons for use in SMS messages. Unfortunately, these emoticons are only officially available to Japanese iPhone users. To access the emoticons there are two common options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jailbreak your iPhone and modify a plist file; or</li>
<li>Download one of the many <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/emoji-free/id332509635?mt=8">free apps</a> that grant access to the emoticons.</li>
</ul>
