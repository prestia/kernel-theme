### About Anthony

Anthony Prestia is an [attorney](http://www.networkadvertising.org/about/staff.asp) & [hacker](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Hacker_\(term\)#Programmer_subculture_of_hackers) living in [Washington, DC](http://proudlymadeindc.com). When he's not writing about himself in the third person, he's probably diving headfirst into a harebrained project that he knows too little about or having a drink at one of his [favorite](http://passengerdc.com/columbia/index.cfm) [local](http://www.meridianpint.com) [spots](http://passengerdc.com).

### About the Site

This website is powered by the hacker-friendly static site generator [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) and a custom template of my own invention called--quite creatively--[kernel-theme](https://github.com/prestia/kernel-theme). Hosting is provided by [StableHost](StableHost). Eye candy and graceful degradation are made possible by [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com), [html5shim](https://code.google.com/p/html5shim/), [hyphenator.â€‹js](https://code.google.com/p/hyphenator/), and [Pygments](http://pygments.org). All development takes place in [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) and [terminal](http://www.apple.com/macosx/what-is-macosx/apps-and-utilities.html#terminal). Posts are written in [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net)'s excellent [markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), saved in plaintext, and interpreted by [Rdiscount](http://rubygems.org/gems/rdiscount). Version control is powered by [Git](http://git-scm.com/).

The source code for [kernel-theme](https://github.com/prestia/kernel-theme) is available on [GitHub](http://github.com) and is totally free (as in speech and beer). I encourage anyone interested in working with [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) give it a look. I would also like to thank [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com) for laying much of the groundwork for [kernel-theme](https://github.com/prestia/kernel-theme) and [Kernel magazine](http://kernelmag.com) for the inspiration.

### Web Standards Statement

This blog adheres to modern web standards, but (against my better judgment) contains [one validation error](http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fprestia.org&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0) in order to help support users still running IE6. While I have done my best to ensure a comparable experience across browsers, I cannot guarantee that this blog will look or run flawlessly on noncompliant browsers. If you have trouble reading this blog in an older version of Internet Explorer, try downloading [Chrome frame](http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/). If you still have a problem, you're probably out of luck.
